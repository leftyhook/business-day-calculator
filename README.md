Excel/VBA Demo - Calculates business dates according to a holiday schedule and business day convention.

## About

As part of the hiring process before I joined the Desktop Build Group as an Excel/VBA specialist at Bloomberg in 2015, they asked me to send over a sample project for them to review. I remember thinking, "Wait, the 8+ years of industry experience described on my resume isn't enough to get me past the initial HR interview, and you actually want me to **prove** I can do this work? Well, alright then, I guess that seems fair." I also remember my next thought: "Uh-oh."

The problem was that every VBA project I had ever done either belonged to the companies I had previously worked for and thus could not be shared even if I had them in my possession (which I didn't), or was a monstrous fantasy football tool that was not designed to be shared with anyone. I needed to come up with something quick, before this job opportunity passed me by.

And so I spent a couple days creating this little tool as a more applicable example of what I could do. It probably has no real-world application (although if you see one, please feel free to use it!), but it demonstrates a wide array of Excel & VBA application design concepts. 

It was instrumental in getting me through the next four rounds of interviews at Bloomberg before eventually securing a job offer. I've given it a fresh update for 2023, and if you're looking for an Excel/VBA developer, please check it out and contact me if you like it!
